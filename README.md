Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using JavaFX and Java. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. When a player clicks a button, the color of the button changes to indicate the player's move.

How to Run the Game
To run the game, make sure you have Java 8 or above installed on your machine. Follow the steps below:

Clone the repository or download the source code files.

Open the project in an IDE of your choice (such as IntelliJ).

Build the project to resolve any dependencies.

Locate the Main class and run it as a Java application.

The Tic Tac Toe game window will appear, and you can start playing.

How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Each cell represents a button that the players can click.

The game starts with Player 1 (typically 'X').

Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to make their move.

When a player clicks a cell, the color of the button changes to indicate the player's move. Player 1's moves are displayed in blue, and Player 2's moves are displayed in red.

The game continues until one of the players wins or the game ends in a draw.

A player wins if they have three of their symbols ('X' or 'O') in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

To play again, click the "Reset" button to clear the grid and start a new game.
